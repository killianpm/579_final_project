# SI 579 Vanilla app

This is my final project for SI 579.
It is acolor scheme tool that allows users to generate and save color schemes.
The user can enter the number of colors they want.
The user can also enter a short description to save color schemes they like.

## To Run the App
The usual npm commands in the project root:
- `npm install` (which should only need to be done once, after that everything is installed )
- `npm start` will start the server so you can access the site via browser

## Files to be aware of
There are several files you don't need to be concerned with.
These are the ones you _should_ be
- `/index.html` is the html served when you start the app
- `/js` is the directory with the JavaScript files loaded by index.html
- `/css` is the directory with the CSS files loaded by index.html
